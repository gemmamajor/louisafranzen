Title of page – Permanent Makeup by Louisa Franzen (writing in Charcoal grey)
 
Her logo will sit to the top right of the page above
 
In the menu box that runs down the right side (charcoal background, soft grey border with white text):

FAQ’s

Then the various contact links at the bottom – facebook, instagram, email etc
